File I/O:
  Completed: 
    - System takes first argument as the input file and reads it correctly.
    - System needs to strip the second argument from args and correctly uses is as the name for the outfile
    - System writes to File
    - Spliting string based on header.
    - Function to convert machine and task to in has been implemented.
    - Parsing Input file into a string. Input file is stored as a string in the variable contents.
    - result for spelling parse error, not a tuple, invalid (M,T) and (T,T) error prints to file 
  Incomplete
    - Converting Strings to Int where required - Fucntions are done, just need the algorithm 
      fucntion to know where you want it converted, how you want it passed.
    - get the final result to in a string and write it to file. 
        - This needs to be done for the algorithm that computes the result.
        - And for no solution cases.
  
Parse correctly
  Complete
    -Parsing name - Checks if name is entered on in one line, if not it s garbage.
    -Parsing partial forced - ensures partial forced follows (M,T)(is a tuple and follow machine task conventions)
    -Parsing forbidden assignments - ensures forbidden follows is a tuple and follow machine and task conventions
    -Parsing too near task - ensure it is a tuple, follows task task convention
  Incomplete 
    -Parsing too near task - not sure if we need to implement an error check for case such as (A,A)
    -Parsing machine penalties
    -Parsing too near penalties
    
Implement Algorithm
  Incomplete:
    -Create a function such that it created every assignment, and add the parsing filter on to it
    -Penalty cost calculations
    -store the final result in a string variable
