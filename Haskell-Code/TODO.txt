    - System needs to strip the second argument from args and correctly uses is as the name for the outfile
    - System writes to File
  Incomplete:

    - Spliting string based on header.
    - get the final result to in a string and write it to file. 
  
Parse correctly
  Incomplete:

    -Parsing too near penalties
    
Implement Algorithm
  Incomplete:
    -Create a function such that it created every assignment, and add the parsing filter on to it
    -Penalty cost calculations
    -store the final result in a string variable
